Description: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Anon is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Anon provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Anon client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Anon network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Anon instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Anon does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Anon depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Anon Project recommends that you use
 the Anon Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Anon, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description: GeoIP database for Anon
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Anon, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Anon relays that aren't listed in the main Anon
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Anon network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Anon controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.
