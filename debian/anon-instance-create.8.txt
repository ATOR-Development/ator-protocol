NAME
----
anon-instance-create - Set up a new anon instance

SYNOPSIS
--------
**anon-instance-create** __instance_name__

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Tor Debian package supports running multiple instances of the Tor
daemon.  This can be useful if you want to run multiple relays or bridge
relays on a single system, of if you want to provide a hidden service in
addition to running a relay.

**anon-instance-create** is the tool that creates a new instance of Tor
on a Debian system.  In particular, it creates a new UNIX user with a
home directory and a mostly empty anon configuration file.

The new user and group are named **_anon-**__instance_name__.  The user's
home directory, which is also the DataDirectory of the new anon instance,
is **/var/lib/anon-instances/**__instance_name__.  The configuration file
for that instance is **/etc/anon/instances/**__instance_name__**/anonrc**.
Logs go to syslog by default.

To start this new service, use
**systemctl start anon@**__instance_name__.  Stopping, restarting, and
reloading the config works accordingly.  Stopping/Starting/.. the
**anon** service should affect all instances.
The "main" instance which lives in /var/lib/anon and has /etc/anon/anonrc
as its configuration file is known to systemd as **anon@default**.

There currently is no **anon-instance-remove** script.  To remove an
instance, delete the user and its homedirectory once you are convinced
there are no files or processes on your system still owned by that user.
Then also remove the corresponding directory tree in /etc/anon/instances.
